        <p class="february">In February 2024, while working for <a target="_blank" href="https://interalliance.org">INTERalliance</a>, I helped execute TechOlympics 2024: Empower, at our brand new venue P&G Towers in Cincinnati. I helped with on-site tech support and registration, and ran a Wiki Races competition and an Internet of Things workshop. Before the event, I updated the website to reflect the upcoming event.</p>
        <p class="january">In January 2024, while working for <a target="_blank" href="https://interalliance.org">INTERalliance</a>, released brand new versions of the INTERalliance.org and TechOlympics.org websites powered by Jekyll and GitHub Pages to replaces the Wordpress versions. This change finally brought of all INTERalliance's websites back in house.</p>

    <div class="description">
        <p class="march">In March 2023, as Vice President of the <a target="_blank" href="https://iot.informatics.plus">Norse IoT Club</a>, I designed a Website Workshop event to teach NKU students basic HTML so they could showcase their skills to employers with a personal resume website. I created a guide that covered connecting to NKU's network drives, six HTML templates, and an index site that used JavaScript to allow students to pick a template with dynamic CSS.</p>
        <p class="march">Also in March, I released <a target="_blank" href="https://tieraway.godsted.com">Tier Away</a>! I started working on it in the summer of the previous year as a hobby project to learn more about JavaScript by developing a client-side tier list designer app. I had used a few other sites like it over the years, but none of them did the job.</p>
        <p class="february">In February 2023, while working for <a target="_blank" href="https://interalliance.org">INTERalliance</a>, I helped execute TechOlympics 2023: Electrify, the first TechOlympics back in person since the pandemic. I helped with on-site tech support and registration, and before the event helped update the website to reflect the upcoming event.</p>

The new site also employs dynamic data for the ILC, Board, and Home pages that can be added to without having to edit the site manually.</p>
        <p class="february">In February 2022, I helped plan and execute TechOlympics 2022: Byte Back, and its accompanying Hackathon. On the day of the event, I helped with Zoom Administration and Whova Moderation. Before the event, I was in charge of updating the website to reflect the event.</p>
