                    <p class="march">In March 2023, as Vice President of the <a target="_blank" href="https://iot.informatics.plus">Norse IoT Club</a>, I designed a Website Workshop event to teach NKU students basic HTML so they could showcase their skills to employers with a personal resume website. I created a guide that covered connecting to NKU's network drives, six HTML templates, and an index site that used JavaScript to allow students to pick a template with dynamic CSS.</p>
                    <p class="march">Also in March, I released <a target="_blank" href="https://tieraway.godsted.com">Tier Away</a>! I started working on it in the summer of the previous year as a hobby project to learn more about JavaScript by developing a client-side tier list designer app. I had used a few other sites like it over the years, but none of them did the job.</p>
                    <p class="february">In February 2023, while working for <a target="_blank" href="https://interalliance.org">INTERalliance</a>, I helped execute TechOlympics 2023: Electrify, the first TechOlympics back in person since the pandemic. I helped with on-site tech support and registration, and before the event helped update the website to reflect the upcoming event.</p>

Our team started from a blank Wordpress site and based on the designs created by our graphic designer, created a new INTERalliance.org in Elementor, a WYSISWYG editor for Wordpress. The new site also employs dynamic data for the ILC, Board, and Home pages that can be added to without having to edit the site manually.</p>
