Over the weekend, I got the chance to help organize TechOlympics 2024, and it has been quite possibly my favourite TechOlympics yet. <!--more-->
I know I'll have more to say about it later on, but from beginning to end it has been an adventure. This year's Leadership Council did an amazing job putting the event together, and I was grateful for the opportunity to step up and work through everything from our registration process to our laptop deployment to, as a first for me, speaking at TechOlympics. Alongside members of Norse IoT, I ran a workshop that allowed students to build their own Internet of Things powered smart sensors. I was amazed by the passion that these students had to learn, and inspired to keep working to make next years event even more incredible.

I just want to thank again everyone who made this event possible, including again our amazing Leadership Council who made this student run event a reality, our Central Office team and INTERalliance board, my co-presenters Riley Weber-Horowitz and Christian Lane, and our sponsors as well as our host Procter and Gamble. Here's to 2025, everyone - it could not be in better hands.
