Amazing show at <a href='https://thecarnegie.com/support/suits-that-rock/'>Suits That Rock 2022</a>. Dad helped to raise $175,000 for The Carnegie's childrens education program (oh, and got to play in front of a sold out crowd of 1,200 people!)<br><br>Suits happens every year, so if you like rock and roll, definitely consider coming by next year.
