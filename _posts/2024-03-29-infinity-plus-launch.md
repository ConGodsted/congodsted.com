I just released a new Minecraft modpack! It's called Infinity Plus, and it expands upon Minecraft 20w14infinite by porting its features to a stable version of Minecraft. You can download it on <a target='_blank' href='https://modrinth.com/modpack/infinity-plus'>Modrinth</a>!

If you haven't heard of it before, 20w14infinite was an April Fools update for Minecraft, where tossing a written book into a Nether Portal creates one of 2,147,483,645 procedurally generated dimensions, based off the contents of the book. Exploring these random dimensions allows players to gain resources as normal, allowing for all sorts of builds with block palettes that are otherwise hard to get in a default Vanilla game.

Infinity Plus takes the gameplay changes and new mechanics from 20w14infinite and re-implements them in 1.20! Explore all new dimensions with the new blocks and items since 1.16's official release, alongside new generator options and all new dimensions!

Infinity Plus is powered by the [Infinite Dimensions mod](https://modrinth.com/mod/infinite-dimensions) and my [Ultimate Content Mod](https://modrinth.com/mod/ultimate-content-mod/) and Ultimate Dimension Pack.
