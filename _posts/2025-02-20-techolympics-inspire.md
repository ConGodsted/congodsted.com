This past weekend, I helped organize TechOlympics 2025, and it was an incredible experience yet again. <!--more-->

As always, this year's Leadership Council did a great job organizing it, and I was able to be involved in everything from registration to this year's incredible website. I also was able to run two sessions: a workshop alongside members of the Norse IoT Club that taught students how to wire microcontrollers, and the ever-popular Wiki Races competition.

This year was my ninth annual TechOlympics, my sixth running the event, and I am still so impressed by the time and care put in to make this event a reality, by everyone from our sponsors, to our volunteers, to our alumni. Thanks especially to my fellow presenters from Norse IoT: Zack Sargent, Riley Weber-Horowitz, and Aaron Milner, without whom the session would not have been possible. I envision a great event in 2026!
