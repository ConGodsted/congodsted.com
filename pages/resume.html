            <h2>Summary</h2>
            <p>
                While primarily a web developer, my work in the nonprofit and education spaces have given me
                opportunities to
                learn a variety of skills, including event management, scripting and automation, as well as basic
                electronics.
                I'm always willing to learn, and I pride myself on being driven to make my work a success.
