            <p>The INTERalliance of Greater Cincinnati is an education focused nonprofit focused on getting local students interested in technology.
                In 2017, I was hired onto INTERalliance as an intern, to handle various IT tasks during the summer while the Leadership Council IT Team was on summer break.
            </p>
            <p>
                I ended up sticking around, and my current role as the Internal Systems Admin at <a target="_blank" href="https://interalliance.org">INTERalliance</a>
                handles all aspects of INTERalliance's IT needs throughout the year, from web development, to Windows and Linux laptop automation, to Python scripting and data analysis.
            </p>
            <p>
                I've also had the opportunity to manage, maintain, and redesign the main INTERalliance and TechOlympics websites, 
                as well as the site for our Wiki Races web app, and through INTERalliance was also given the opportunity to redesign
                 the website for the Carnegie, a local theater in Covington, KY.
            </p>
            <p>
                My biggest contribution to INTERalliance is the new versions of <a href="https://interalliance.org">INTERalliance.org</a> and <a href="https://techolympics.org">TechOlympics.org</a>, as well as the  website for <a href="https://wiitcincy.interalliance.org">WiIT Cincy</a>. 
                They're powered by GitHub Pages, make use of Jekyll for dynamic data, and are automatically backed up in case of emergency. 
                While not as initially user friendly as the former Wordpress and Elementor powered sites, they allow new ILC members to learn 
                the foundations of HTML and CSS in a safe and backed up environment.

                In 2022, I was elected Vice President of the <a href="https://norseiot.club">Norse IoT Club</a> at NKU. As Vice President, 
                I built an interface for scanning members Student IDs to check them into events, and was responsible for planning and executing
                our Website Workshops event, where we built HTML/CSS resumes for students to share on their personal NKU websites.

                One of the chief benefits of this migration was that it was now able to be easily changed by myself and other club leadership
                and even interested members.

            <p>
                One of my first personal projects was a site called Tier Away. Tier Away served as a tier list generator. Tier lists,
                for those unfamiliar, are a quick and easy way to rank various similar things, from the highest S Tier to the lowest F
                Tier.
            </p>
            <p>
                Tier Away was prompted by my personal frustration that the only prominent tier list maker program required you to sign
                in with a social media account, and required that all tier lists you make be public. Tier Away did away with that, and
                let users dynamically make their own tier lists.
            </p>
            <p>
                With the help of Luke Trenaman, who I had previously worked with on the INTERalliance Website Redesign in 2022, we built
                Tier Away in Summer of 2022. Tier Away is still in development but at this point
                it fulfills my needs for private tier list generation.

                In 2024, I began to work on a digital signage app called JustServe. JustServe is designed to be a simple and reliable digital signage solution that
                allows for a self-hosted server to show content on multiple connected clients.
            </p>
            <p>
                The server can be self-hosted on any Linux machine with NodeJS, and all a client needs to connect is a web browser (with WebSocket support). 
                This solution is ideal for conferences that want greater control over their digital signage without needing to pay for a cloud solution.
            </p>
            <p>
                JustServe is still in active alpha development, so its not ready for production use.
